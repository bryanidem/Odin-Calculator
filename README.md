# Odin Calculator

> You made it! By now you should have a really firm grasp on the fundamentals of JavaScript. Of course there’s plenty more to learn, but you should be able to create quite a bit at this point. Our final project is going to combine everything you’ve learned so far: you’re going to make an on-screen calculator using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

I learned more about flexbox, honestly i dont think flexbox is suited to this project, Grid fits better, but i just followed the instruction. I used more javascript on this project, and i know it have some flaws, i just dont want to spend too much on this project.
